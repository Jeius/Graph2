Graph Illustrator is a Python-based tool that allows you to visually explore and interact with graph algorithms, including Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, and Floyd's algorithms. 
It supports directed and undirected graphs, and provides functionality for displaying the complement of a graph. 
This tool is designed to help users better understand and visualize the workings of key graph algorithms in a graphical interface.

# Features
## Graph Algorithms:

- Prim's Algorithm: Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph.
- Kruskal's Algorithm: Another approach to finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, based on edge sorting.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
- Graph Complement: Easily visualize the complement of a given graph, where edges are flipped between existing and non-existing connections.

## Directed and Undirected Graphs: Switch between directed and undirected graph representations with full support for the corresponding algorithms.

## Interactive Interface: The tool provides a graphical interface to interact with the graph, add/remove vertices and edges, and run the algorithms visually.
