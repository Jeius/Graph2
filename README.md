Graph Illustrator is a Python-based tool that allows you to visually explore and interact with graph algorithms, including Prim's, Kruskal's, Dijkstra's, and Floyd's algorithms. 
It supports directed and undirected graphs, and provides functionality for displaying the complement of a graph. 
This tool is designed to help users better understand and visualize the workings of key graph algorithms in a graphical interface.

## Features
### Graph Algorithms:

- Prim's Algorithm: Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph.
- Kruskal's Algorithm: Another approach to finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, based on edge sorting.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
- Graph Complement: Easily visualize the complement of a given graph, where edges are flipped between existing and non-existing connections.

### Directed and Undirected Graphs: 
Switch between directed and undirected graph representations with full support for the corresponding algorithms.

### Interactive Interface: 
The tool provides a graphical interface to interact with the graph, add/remove vertices and edges, and run the algorithms visually.

## Usage
### 1. Graph Creation
Add vertices and edges to the graph by clicking on the canvas.
Toggle between directed and undirected graphs using the provided options.
### 2. Algorithm Execution
Prim's Algorithm: Select the starting vertex, then click on "Find MCST" to visualize the Minimum Spanning Tree.
Kruskal's Algorithm: Similarly, select the starting vertex and click on "Find MCST" to generate the MST using Kruskalâ€™s method.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Select a source vertex and click "Find Path" to find the shortest paths from that vertex to all others.
Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Select Floyd and click "Find Path" to calculate the shortest paths between all vertex pairs.
### 3. Graph Complement
Generate and view the complement of the graph by clicking the "Show Complement", which includes all edges that are not present in the original graph.
### 4. Interactive Features
Zoom in and out of the graph canvas.
Move vertices around to see how the algorithms behave with different graph layouts.
Highlight specific edges or vertices for better clarity when running algorithms.
